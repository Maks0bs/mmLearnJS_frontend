# **mmLearnJS**

The goal of this project is to create a customizable, flexible and 
easy-to-use learning platform.

## Project

The project itself is 
[this website](https://mmlearnjs.maks0bs.com). You are
welcome to visit the site and play around with it.
On the home page you will find a quick feature overview / tutorial 
about how to navigate through the website and how to use various
functionality. 

## Tools
mmLearnJS was built with React. The React App was built with the 
help of Redux state management.
Styling was made with Bootstrap, and some other custom patterns.
The website uses [the mmLearnJS API](https://github.com/Maks0bs/mmLearnJS_backend)
for all requests.

## Documentation

[here](https://docs.mmlearnjs.maks0bs.com).
